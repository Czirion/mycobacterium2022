# PubMLST database

## Download metadata

- Go to [PubMLST home page](https://pubmlst.org/).  
- Enter *Mycobacteria* spp. in the Organism search bar.  
- On the result box click on `Genome collections`.  
- Go to the bottom of the page to the `Analysis tools` section and in the `Export:` subsection click on the `Dataset` button.  
- In the box `Provenance fields` click `All`, and then click `SUBMIT`.  A page called `Job status viewer` will appear.
- When the `Output`box appears, click on the `Tar file containing all output files`.
- Extract the file and change the name of the `txt` to `pubmlst_metadata.tsv`.

## Download genomes

- Go back two pages to the `Search or browse database` and go again to the `Analysis tools` section and in the `Export:` subsection click on the `Contigs` button.  
- **I will waint until knowing which genomes are useful** because I can only download 1000 genomes at a time.
